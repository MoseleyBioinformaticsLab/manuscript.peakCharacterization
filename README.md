This is a code repository to reproduce the following manuscript:

Scan-Centric, Frequency-Based Method for Characterizing Peaks from Direct Injection Fourier transform Mass Spectrometry Experiments

Robert M Flight, Joshua M Mitchell, Hunter N.B. Moseley

doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.14.488423


If you look closely, you will notice that a lot of the data in the _targets.R file and other files is not listed here.
That is because it is 5.1 GB after zipping, so there was no way we were putting that in the git repo.

There will be instructions on how to clone, setup and get this running, just not today.
I need a break after getting the manuscript done.
