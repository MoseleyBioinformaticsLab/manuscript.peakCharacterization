## TODO

What issues need to be addressed before we have a manuscript:

* check whether normalization is constant across M/Z space (SIRM.FTMS.peakCharacterization #27)

* useable data: we really need a data-set that we can demonstrate the issue, and then how things are fixed. Even better if it's public.
